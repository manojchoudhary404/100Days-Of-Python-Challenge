# üêç 100 Days of Python Projects üöÄ
By Manoj Choudhary~

Welcome to my collection of Python projects from the 100 Days of Code challenge! This repository includes a wide variety of projects that demonstrate my growing proficiency in Python, ranging from web scraping to automation, data analysis, and web development.

#### Most projects ideas come from the Udemy course: [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code)

# üìù Project Overview
This project contains 100 Python-based projects covering topics like automation, web development, and data handling. It's perfect for developers, students, and hobbyists looking to improve their Python skills or find inspiration for real-world applications.

- Aspiring developers looking to improve their Python skills.
- Students seeking hands-on coding experience.
- Professionals wanting to automate tasks or build web applications.
- Hobbyists interested in experimenting with Python  and building fun or practical tools.

## üöÄ How to Get Started
If you‚Äôd like to try out any of these projects or use them as a reference for your own work, you can easily set them up locally:

1) Clone the Repository
Use the following command to clone the repo to your local machine:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/remarkeyable//100Days-Of-Python-Challenge.git
```
2) Navigate to a Project
Once cloned, navigate to any specific day‚Äôs project folder:

```bash
  cd <file name>
```
3) Install Dependencies
Most projects will have a requirements.txt file listing the necessary Python libraries. Install them with:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4) Run the Project
Follow the instructions in each project‚Äôs README to run the code. For most automation projects, make sure you have the correct web drivers installed (e.g., ChromeDriver for Selenium).
 
    
## üìö Learning Highlights
Throughout this journey, I've enhanced my skills in:

- Python automation, including bots and scrapers
- Web development using Flask
- API integration
- Data handling and visualization
- Full-stack development

## üìù Future Plans
### The 100 Days of Code challenge was just the beginning! Here are some areas I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring in the future:

- Advanced Machine Learning & AI: Deepening my knowledge in AI and ML by integrating libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn into future projects.
- Blockchain Development: Exploring decentralized applications and the power of blockchain technology (as part of my ongoing interest in blockchain).
- Full-Stack Web Development: Expanding my skills to cover full-stack development using frameworks like Django and React.
